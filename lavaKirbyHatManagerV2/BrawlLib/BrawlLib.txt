|************ Change Log ************|
 ====================================

 Changes beginning with an asterisk (*) affect BrawlCrate behavior,
 while changes beginning with a period (.) serve to add/modify
 features that BrawlCrate doesn't use.

 See BrawlCrate's Changelog.txt for more recent changes (mid-2014 and newer.)

 (7/26/2014) - BrawlLib 0.20b
 	* BLOC archives are now rebuildable
		* GSND files are now partially editable
	* Module ID->name list now embedded (not loaded from text file)

 (6/28/2014) - BrawlLib 0.20a
    * See BrawlCrate 0.73a changelog (additions to interpolation editor, RELNode)
	* BrawlLib.SSBB.Stage added - keeps a list of Brawl stages' names, filenames, and IDs

 (6/3/2014) - BrawlLib 0.20
    * More support for Subspace Emissary data formats
    * Moved AttributeGrid to BrawlLib (from Ikarus)
    * Fixed MSBin encoding for empty strings

 (5/4/2014) - BrawlLib 0.19.1
    * Fixed UTF-8 encoding (was corrupting files)

 (5/3/2014) - BrawlLib 0.19L
    * MSBin strings are now properly encoded/decoded to/from UTF-8, instead of just ASCII
	  * Fixes the appearance of strings like "Pokémon" and allows editing of non-Latin text
    . MD5EnsureChildrenIncluded and its friends moved to a new file called NodeDeepChecksum

 (4/6/2014) - BrawlLib v0.18L3
    . ResourceNode.MD5EnsureChildrenIncluded() or MD5StrEnsureChildrenIncluded(): will XOR own MD5 sum with those of children if children aren't already included in the node's own data

 (3/13/2014) - BrawlLib v0.18L2
	* When exporting BRES entries (TEX0, MDL0, etc.), reset the BRES index offset (0x0c, 4 bytes) to 0 so that exported files with the same data will be identical
	. Implement MD5() and MD5Str() functions to get checksums of resource node data
      . Note: result of MD5() is NOT guaranteed to match what the MD5 checksum of a node's data would be after being exported to a separate file
	. Override MD5() for BRESEntryNode to simulate the export behavior, so checksums of identical nodes will match

 (2/13/2014) - BrawlLib v0.18L
	. Added the HideMDL0Errors assembly property, which will prevent dialog boxes from appearing when MDL0 errors are detected
	. Added the InitialSize and InitialFormat properties to TextureConverterDialog
	. Added Volume and VolumePercent properties to AudioPlaybackPanel
	* Don't crash when editing MDL0 models without any objects defined
