# lavaKirbyHatManagerV2
A fully rebuilt version of the original [lavaKirbyHatManager](https://github.com/QuickLava/lavaKirbyHatManager) program, which offers compatibility with the new and improved EX Kirby Hat system featured in Project+ Ex v1.5 and beyond, as well as a brand new editor UI!

***Important Note:*** *While Kirby Hat compatibility has improved in the new system relative to the old one, Hat compatibility is still* ***very*** *spotty, and many source characters still don't work. This will change as fixes are developed for other Hats, but for the moment things are (and will remain) somewhat limited. For preliminary compatibility information, see [this chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rlw8wemQ849w-6AgGISXATPv6-pfVnTTQcQqd6N-crI/edit?usp=sharing).*
